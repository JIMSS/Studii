Facebook is by far the most popular tool, followed by Google Docs and Yahoo Answers (among non-Uvic services)

lots of people use coursespaces

Forums and Chatrooms are unpopular, private messaging is relatively popular

General QA tools are more popular than academically focused ones

people like real time collaborative tools and not file sharing tools or image based ones

Toxicity of the community isn't particularly important to adoption and anonymity is a bonus at best

The registration process and interface are important

I suspect that if we had included the universality of the tools in our options it would have been high as well



Ideas:

	- Make the forums public or private based on the preference of the creator
	- focus on the QA design over the forum design, people hate forums
	- make it really easy for people to access it to avoid problems with getting people to create accounts and shit, the community sorts itself out and the anonmyity isn't a huge issue
	- have a private message feature?
	- expiry/archiving dates on courses/topics at creation
		- increment archive dates by months, give option to get more specific (days)
	- general discussion topic on new boards by default
	- don't need account to look at course page, just to participate, save courses
	- When creating a board you must provide the name of the board/class and an organization (company, school, expo...)
	-
